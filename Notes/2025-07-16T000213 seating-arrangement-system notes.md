 1. The event can set a host organization, means the event is hosting by them. Just choose the Organization. 
2. The organization can be more detailed in order: organization can be order in a page. The organization would be like a card. And the roles under the organization also have order. For example: JCI, JCIHK(please notice that they are two organizations, one is the national JCI, one is regional JCI chapters) .and under JCIHK, there will be 21 chapters. So JCI got like JCIHK, JCI Marco, JCI Japan. And for each regional chapter also got their more specific children chapters. Also, there will be some government departments. Like Hong Kong government. And I will like the page can reorder the different departments first. There will be a button to save after rearrange the order. then, click the each departments/organizations’s name, the children chapters will be displayed in a list. 
3. the Create Event page, the guest can be deleted before create event.
4. Nav bar only: Events, Persons, Organizations (reorder roles put it onto Organizations page). and Persons and Organizations, the path is #, no response
